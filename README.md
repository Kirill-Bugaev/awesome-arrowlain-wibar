Wibar in arrow style with modified Lain widgets for Awesome WM

This project was inspired by [lcpz/awesome-copycast][] Powerarrow theme and Vim [Powerline][] plugin. It uses modified Lain library for Awesome WM, original can be found at [lcpz/lain][].

### Introduction

This wibar is an extension for Awesome WM which allows you to monitor system and hardware state, current weather and forecast, mailboxes, etc. See the [screenshots][] below for a demonstration of the wibar capabilities.

The most laborious part is configuring widgets is described in [configuration][] section.

See the [troubleshooting][] section if you're having any issues with the wibar.
